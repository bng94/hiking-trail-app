# Hiking-Trail-App

An android native web app, made through angular through ionic framework. This app need access to your phone's GPS  to returns possible hiking trails around your current  location 
that you can hike at and access to google maps if you decide to select the path and travel to the path.

This project was a final project for one of my graduate class to create an web application that I will be using after finishing the class. As a hiker who enjoys hiking with friends, I 
thought this app would be a great idea for myself and my friends to use when we decide to go hiking as a group again.
